- 👋 Hi, I’m @gameDev53
- 👀 Game Development is my main interest.
- 🌱 Spy, detective, cop, and crime shows are my go-to for entertainment.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on game development projects.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me.
- ⚡ Fun fact - When I was a kid, I fearlessly took a dip in a lake during early spring when most of it was still frozen, with just a tiny 2-meter section melted near the shore!
